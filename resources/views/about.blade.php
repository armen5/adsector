		<p class="p2-abt w4-abt wow slideInRight">One of the most frustrating parts about running an ecommerce business is consistently finding products that sell well. Most people who get started in ecommerce, end up quitting because of the frustration that comes with testing products that don't convert and losing money.</p>
		<p class="p3-abt cmntxt m1-abt w5-abt wow zoomIn mb30 mt50">We are ecommerce sellers ourselves so we know exactly what goes into finding winning products. We have tried to guess what products will work and lost thousands of dollars testing. And that is why we created AdGrabr.</p>

		<p class="p3-abt cmntxt m2-abt w5-abt wow zoomIn">AdGrabr gives you the ability to find out exactly what is already working in ecommerce in your market right now! Find products that are selling recently so that you can pull a profit fast. Stop guessing and start profiting with AdGrabr.</p>
